        "From the exploratory data analysis, we can observe several key patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Height and Attack Performance**  \n",
        "   Taller players generally achieve higher success in attacking (spike points and efficiency). This suggests that height provides an advantage in offensive actions, especially for outside hitters and opposites.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Height and Blocking**  \n",
        "   There is a clear positive correlation between height and blocking success. Middle blockers in particular benefit significantly from greater height.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Height and Defense (Reception/Dig)**  \n",
        "   Height seems to have limited or even negative influence on reception and digging performance. Shorter players, often liberos, still perform strongly in these roles, indicating that technique and positioning outweigh height.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Overall Scoring**  \n",
        "   While taller players tend to score more through attack and block, the contribution of shorter players in defense is equally critical for the team's success.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Research Questions\n",
        "- To what extent can height predict scoring contribution in different positions?  \n",
        "- How do technical skills compensate for the lack of height in positions like libero or setter?  \n",
        "- Can teams balance height distribution to maximize both offense and defense?\n"
